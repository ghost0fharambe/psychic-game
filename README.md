# Psychic Letter Guess

A simple web application that uses javascript to randomly select a letter from an array containing the alphabet and allows users to press buttons on the keyboard in order to guess the letter. Keeps track of wins and losses per session, as well as counts the users guesses and subtracts them from the alloted guess amount
Created as an assignment for the University of Arizona Web Development Boot Camp.
